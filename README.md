AI PR Reviewer is a VS Code extension designed to enhance the pull request workflow by introducing AI-driven code review directly within the development environment. The extension analyzes code differences between feature branches and the main branch before merge, enabling developers to identify potential issues early in the development lifecycle. By leveraging an integrated AI review engine, it evaluates code changes for security vulnerabilities, hardcoded credentials, poor naming conventions, unresolved TODO/FIXME comments, duplicate code patterns, large changesets, and other maintainability concerns.

The extension provides structured feedback categorized by severity levels such as errors, warnings, informational notes, and suggestions, allowing developers to prioritize fixes efficiently. It also includes a customizable checklist system that enables teams to define and toggle review rules according to their coding standards. Additionally, users can inject custom review policies to enforce project-specific governance requirements, making the tool adaptable to different team environments and development practices.

By embedding intelligent review automation directly into VS Code, AI PR Reviewer reduces manual code review overhead, improves code quality consistency, and strengthens pre-merge validation processes. The project demonstrates the integration of AI models with developer tooling, Git-based workflows, rule-engine design, and interactive extension UI development to create a streamlined and scalable code quality solution.
